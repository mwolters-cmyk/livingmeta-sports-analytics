  "_comment": "Example gap analysis contribution demonstrating the expected quality and format. This example follows the coach dismissal case: a master's student read a Volkskrant article about whether firing football coaches actually improves performance. Based on a platform search that found limited papers in the database, the agent produces a gap analysis that honestly acknowledges the coverage limitations while identifying actionable research directions.",
