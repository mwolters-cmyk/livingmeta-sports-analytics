      "confidence": "medium",
      "scope": "This question is well-scoped but ambitious. It asks two related sub-questions: (1) predictability of race outcomes (binary/ordinal prediction problem), and (2) feature importance/driver analysis. The database contains 86 cycling papers, but only ~10-12 directly address race outcome prediction. Most papers study performance physiology, training, or power metrics—prerequisites for prediction but not prediction itself. The question assumes race outcome prediction is actively studied; our evidence suggests it is emerging but underexplored. The scope is appropriate for a gap analysis: it identifies a real research frontier.",

The promise of load monitoring and real-time biomechanical feedback is huge, but how much evidence is there that wearable data leads to fewer injuries rather than just better documentation of them?",
      "papers_analyzed": 1749,
      "confidence": "medium",
      "scope": "This is a well-scoped and clinically urgent question. It correctly identifies a gap between promise and proof: the database contains 189 injury prevention papers (10.8% of 1749), yet the research question asks the critical distinction between *predictive validity* (sensors prevent injury) vs. *postdictive utility* (sensors document injury). The question is appropriately skeptical—most wearable research measures load or biomechanics, not injury *reduction*. However, the framing could benefit from clarity: 'prevent' can mean (a) causal intervention reducing incidence, or (b) predictive screening enabling prevention. The database appears to contain mostly the latter.",

The question assumes cycling has analogous 'player valuation' problems to football, which is partly true but not equivalent—cycling is predominantly individual performance within team tactics, while football is mixed. The research question is ambitious but answerable with our database, though cycling analysis will be severely limited.",

      "scope": "This research question is BROAD and MULTI-FACETED, touching on three distinct but interconnected domains: (1) fan experience/engagement, (2) psychological/emotional effects of analytics exposure, and (3) behavioral changes in media consumption. The question also contains an implicit hypothesis (analytics either enhances OR diminishes engagement) that may be false—the relationship could be conditional, heterogeneous, or null. The question conflates several mechanisms: availability of analytics, fan consumption of analytics, understanding of analytics, and emotional responses to them. To be well-scoped, this would benefit from separating: (a) what data exists on fan engagement with analytics-driven content; (b) whether analytics exposure causally affects enjoyment/engagement; (c) whether it affects viewing behavior (consumption patterns); and (d) whether it affects emotional investment. Our database has minimal direct evidence on any of these.",

However, the question conflates two related but distinct concepts: prediction (identifying who will be injured) and prevention (reducing injury occurrence). The papers in the database heavily emphasize prediction over causal prevention interventions, which is a significant distinction the analysis must address.

      "confidence": "low",
      "scope": "This question is well-scoped but addresses a critical gap: it asks for normative guidance (should rules be adapted?) based on empirical evidence that largely does not exist in our database. The research question conflates three distinct sub-questions: (1) Do performance/physiological differences between men and women warrant rule adaptations? (2) What are the effects of rule adaptations on performance equity and fairness? (3) Is women's football specifically disadvantaged by current rules? Our database contains abundant gender-comparative performance data but virtually no evidence on rule adaptation effects. The question assumes rule adaptation is a viable policy lever—this assumption is untested empirically in women's football.",

Confidence in identifying WHAT HAS BEEN STUDIED about bias: MEDIUM (we have some papers on home advantage, referee decision-making under load, and judge consistency). Confidence in comparative findings across judged vs. refereed sports: LOW (sparse data, no direct comparisons). Confidence in what REMAINS UNMEASURED: MEDIUM-HIGH (we can identify obvious gaps, but would need domain expertise to know what methodologies exist outside our database).",
      "scope": "This is a well-motivated but VERY BROAD research question that attempts to integrate three distinct research domains: (1) referee bias in refereed sports, (2) judge bias in judged sports, and (3) comparative analysis across both types. The question assumes these phenomena are 'rarely studied together' but this is partly a symptom of genuine fragmentation in the literature — not necessarily that the question is unanswerable. However, the scope needs narrowing: the papers in our database heavily emphasize PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (1,353 papers) vs BIAS DETECTION (only 57 papers). The bias literature is thin and scattered across sports. A more focused version would ask: 'What measures of referee/judge bias exist in [specific sport], and what methodologies have proven most reliable?' The comparative frame is intellectually interesting but our database may lack sufficient bias papers across all six sports to support strong comparative conclusions.",

      "confidence": "low",
      "scope": "This question is well-scoped but requires careful interpretation. It makes a specific comparative claim: that the money-performance relationship differs across sports. The database contains 1320 football papers and only moderate coverage of other sports (basketball: 476, athletics: 373, volleyball: 173, etc.), which creates an inherent asymmetry in what can be studied. The question assumes that 'spending' and 'league position' are measurable constructs across diverse sports with different financial structures (e.g., salary caps in some sports, no caps in others; different league structures). The database overwhelmingly focuses on performance analysis (4499 papers) rather than financial-competitive relationships, which is the core of this question. This is a significant limitation.",

      "scope": "This question is well-scoped but with notable caveats. It targets a specific phenomenon (pacing strategy and split times) across defined endurance sports (running, cycling; speed skating is notably underrepresented). The question conflates two related but distinct inquiries: (1) what pacing strategy is optimal, and (2) how pacing profiles relate to performance. These require different analytical approaches—the first is prescriptive/normative, the second is descriptive/correlational. The database contains substantial work on pacing in running and cycling but minimal coverage of speed skating.

Triathlon (swimming-cycling-running) and biathlon (cross-country skiing-shooting) share endurance cores but differ fundamentally; decathlon is a track-and-field combined event with explosive and endurance components. The term 'optimal' assumes a single best strategy, which is likely sport-, level-, and individual-dependent. A more rigorous framing would specify: optimal for whom (elite/developmental/recreational), at what level (youth/adult), in which distance (sprint/Olympic/long/Ironman), and measured by what outcome (podium placement/personal improvement/health).

The question is neither too narrow nor too broad—it sits at the heart of applied sports analytics. However, 'most effective' is ambiguous: effective for what outcome (winning, goal-scoring, possession retention, defensive solidity)? And 'tactical approaches' spans formations, pressing, transitions, set pieces, and passing styles. The literature addresses these implicitly through outcome correlation studies but rarely isolates causality. The second part (measurement) is better covered by methodological papers.
