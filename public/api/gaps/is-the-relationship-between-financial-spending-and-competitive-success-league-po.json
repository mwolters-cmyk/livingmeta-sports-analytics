  "scope_assessment": "This question is well-scoped but requires careful interpretation. It makes a specific comparative claim: that the money-performance relationship differs across sports. The database contains 1320 football papers and only moderate coverage of other sports (basketball: 476, athletics: 373, volleyball: 173, etc.), which creates an inherent asymmetry in what can be studied. The question assumes that 'spending' and 'league position' are measurable constructs across diverse sports with different financial structures (e.g., salary caps in some sports, no caps in others; different league structures). The database overwhelmingly focuses on performance analysis (4499 papers) rather than financial-competitive relationships, which is the core of this question. This is a significant limitation.",
  "database_coverage": "Our database has poor coverage of the research needed to answer this question. We have 37 papers addressing player valuation/transfer market topics, but almost none directly examine the relationship between financial spending aggregated at the team level and competitive outcomes. The one paper on NBA analytics investment (W4408557862) provides evidence that analytics spending (proxy for investment) improves wins, but this is not team salary/spending. We have transfer fee determination papers (W4321367797, W4283159414) but these focus on individual player valuation, not team-level spending-performance relationships. We have no systematic studies of salary cap relationships to performance across sports. The papers on football financial fair play (W4406243376) examine accounting practices, not spending-performance relationships. This appears to be a significant gap in our collection—likely an active research area in sports economics that is underrepresented in a database focused on sports analytics with AI/ML methods.",
  "confidence_explanation": "The database contains insufficient evidence to address the research question. We found zero papers directly comparing the relationship between aggregate team financial spending and competitive success (league position) across football and other sports. We have one tangential NBA paper on analytics investment. The question requires cross-sport comparative analysis of salary/spending versus league position, which our collection does not contain. To increase confidence, we would need: (1) multiple studies examining team salary vs. final league position in football across seasons; (2) equivalent studies in 3-4 other sports with comparable methodology; (3) direct statistical comparisons of correlation strengths or regression coefficients across sports. We have none of these.",

    "summary": "The database is dominated by performance analysis research (4499 papers), with a particular focus on technical-tactical metrics, physical demands, and machine learning applications for prediction. Player valuation research exists (269 papers) but concentrates on individual transfer fees and market value rather than team-level financial spending. The football research is substantially larger than other sports (1320 papers vs. 476 for basketball, 373 for athletics), but this does not reflect an evidence base for comparing money-performance relationships. Notably, papers on financial fair play regulations (W4406243376 on Spanish La Liga) examine creative accounting practices, not the fundamental spending-success relationship. The single most relevant paper on NBA analytics investment (W4408557862) found that each additional analyst contributes ~1.25 wins, but this measures investment in data infrastructure, not team salary spending. Transfer market research (W4321367797 systematic review of 29 papers) identifies determinants of player valuation but does not address whether team spending predicts league position. There is no comparative cross-sport literature in the database examining whether the money-wins relationship differs between football and other sports.",

The cost/benefit is unfavorable: we spent significant effort synthesizing an empty result. However, this null result is valuable: it clearly identifies (1) that the research question is outside the scope of the database's research community, and (2) where to look for relevant literature (sports economics). A better process would have been to conduct a pre-analysis assessment of whether the database was likely to contain literature on financial-competitive relationships, identify it as an economics question, and recommend the user consult sports economics sources. For future analyses, adding domain classification to papers would enable this assessment upfront. The 200-paper limit was sufficient to identify the absence; reading all 5392 papers would not change the conclusion."
