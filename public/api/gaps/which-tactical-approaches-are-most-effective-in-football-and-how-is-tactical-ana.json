  "analysis_confidence": "high",
  "scope_assessment": "This is a well-scoped but expansive two-part question: (1) effectiveness of tactics, and (2) measurement methods. The question is neither too narrow nor too broad—it sits at the heart of applied sports analytics. However, 'most effective' is ambiguous: effective for what outcome (winning, goal-scoring, possession retention, defensive solidity)? And 'tactical approaches' spans formations, pressing, transitions, set pieces, and passing styles. The literature addresses these implicitly through outcome correlation studies but rarely isolates causality. The second part (measurement) is better covered by methodological papers. The question would benefit from clarity on sport level (elite vs. grassroots), gender, and outcome of interest.",
  "database_coverage": "Excellent coverage of tactical measurement methods (146 papers, all on tactical analysis). Strong in: deep learning for tactic detection, passing network analysis, formation identification, defensive/offensive pattern mining, and set-piece analysis. Moderate coverage of: causal effectiveness (most papers are correlational), women's football (10 papers, 6.8%), non-European leagues (sparse), and grassroots football. Notable gap: very few studies directly compare tactic effectiveness across competition levels or with experimental/quasi-experimental designs. The 2024-2025 surge (93 papers) suggests emerging interest in AI-driven tactic discovery and explainability.",
  "confidence_explanation": "Strong confidence due to large sample size (146 papers), consistent theme focus (100% on tactical analysis), and breadth of methodologies represented (10+ distinct methods). Confidence is tempered by: (1) publication year skew (63% from 2024-2025, risking recency bias and incomplete maturity of newer work); (2) low effect size/CI reporting (only 6 and 7 papers respectively, making evidence strength assessment difficult); (3) heavy reliance on proprietary data (17 restricted, 8 proprietary vs. 7 fully open), limiting reproducibility and cross-validation; (4) minimal replication studies. Synthesis across papers is challenging because most are methodological/exploratory rather than hypothesis-testing (few true experimental designs). This analysis would be significantly strengthened by full-text access and access to restricted datasets.",
  "landscape": {
    "summary": "Football tactical analysis has evolved from manual video observation to data-driven AI-assisted systems. The field is dominated by descriptive studies identifying patterns (passing networks, formations, pressing intensity, transition play) and machine learning approaches automating tactic detection. Key findings cluster around four themes: (1) formation and passing patterns correlate with team performance, (2) defensive compactness and pressing intensity are measurable via tracking data, (3) set pieces (corners, throw-ins) have exploitable tactical patterns, and (4) transition play (defense-to-offense, offense-to-defense) is tactically critical but under-analyzed. However, evidence for 'which tactics are *most effective*' remains largely correlational; few studies establish causal links between specific tactics and match outcomes. Measurement has shifted from manual notational analysis to automated detection via deep learning on tracking and event data, enabling real-time coaching support (e.g., TacticAI). The field is fragmentary—papers identify tactical metrics independently rather than building cumulative evidence.",

Cost-benefit: at ~5-10 minutes per paper to read summaries, taxonomy, and metadata, total effort ~15-20 hours. This is economical for gap identification but insufficient for a systematic review (which would require full-text, quality appraisal, risk-of-bias assessment, adding 10-20× effort). The analysis confidently identified major structural gaps (causality, replication, standardization, population coverage) but missed finer-grained debates within narrow topics due to fragmentation. To improve cost-effectiveness: (1) full-text abstracts (200-500 words) instead of 1-3 sentences, (2) standardized extraction forms (methods, N, effect size, outcome) for all papers would enable automated meta-analysis, (3) flagging of preprints vs. peer-reviewed would reduce publication bias.
