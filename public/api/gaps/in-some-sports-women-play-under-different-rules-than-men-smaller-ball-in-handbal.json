  "analysis_confidence": "low",
  "scope_assessment": "This question is well-scoped but addresses a critical gap: it asks for normative guidance (should rules be adapted?) based on empirical evidence that largely does not exist in our database. The research question conflates three distinct sub-questions: (1) Do performance/physiological differences between men and women warrant rule adaptations? (2) What are the effects of rule adaptations on performance equity and fairness? (3) Is women's football specifically disadvantaged by current rules? Our database contains abundant gender-comparative performance data but virtually no evidence on rule adaptation effects. The question assumes rule adaptation is a viable policy lever—this assumption is untested empirically in women's football.",
  "database_coverage": "Our database has strong coverage of women's sports performance analysis (266 papers, 21.3% of collection) and 503 football papers, but critically lacks papers examining rule adaptations as an intervention. We have excellent data on sex-based performance differences across sports (athletics, basketball, volleyball, handball) but zero papers explicitly testing whether adapted rules improve equity or performance in women's football. The database contains rich biomechanical, physiological, and match-performance data on women athletes but no intervention studies on rule modifications.",
  "confidence_explanation": "Confidence is LOW because: (1) The core research question—effects of adapted rules on women's football—is absent from our database. We can describe what IS different between men and women (high confidence), but not whether rule changes would help (very low confidence). (2) We have only 9 papers with primary gender-equity focus out of 1246; most are peripheral to the question. (3) The database provides no evidence on fairness outcomes, rule implementation, or athlete/stakeholder perspectives on adaptation. (4) Cross-sport rule adaptation studies (volleyball, handball) are also absent. To properly answer this question would require: empirical trials of adapted rules, athlete feedback studies, fairness frameworks, and qualitative research on implementation—none of which are in our collection. We can identify what SHOULD be studied, but cannot assess whether it HAS been studied outside our database.",
  "landscape": {
    "summary": "The database documents substantial sex-based physiological and performance differences across sports, particularly in strength, power, and speed metrics. Women consistently show lower absolute performance in sprint times (W4391592359, W4405390422), jumping ability (W4406891392), and maximum power output, though these differences vary dramatically by sport and metric. However, the database contains almost no research on rule adaptations as a policy solution. The few papers touching gender equity (W3113340799, W4410044167, W4407690981) address transgender inclusion and spectator consumption—not rule modifications. In sports with adapted rules (volleyball, handball), our database lacks comparative studies of rule effects on performance or fairness. Instead, the literature is dominated by performance analysis: how fast women run, how high they jump, position-specific demands, training responses. This is a research portfolio focused on describing female athletes, not on designing better rules for them.",

The breadth of papers examined was valuable for identifying what IS and IS NOT studied—the null finding (zero rule-adaptation papers) is itself important. However, marginal returns diminished sharply after ~300 papers: subsequent papers added performance data but no new conceptual frameworks or gap identification. KEY INSIGHT: For future gap analyses, the platform should prioritize PURPOSIVE sampling over exhaustive review when the question is exploratory. For this question, sampling 100 papers across gender-equity, women-specific, and rule-related categories would have yielded 90% of the insight in 20% of the cost. The 1,200-paper exhaustive review confirmed that rule-adaptation research simply does not exist in analytics databases—a finding that could have been detected with targeted sampling. RECOMMENDATION: Develop a heuristic for assigning 'conceptual relevance' independently of 'AI-assessed relevance' to pre-filter papers for exploratory gap analysis. For policy-oriented questions, this would dramatically improve cost-efficiency and identify interdisciplinary gaps more clearly."
