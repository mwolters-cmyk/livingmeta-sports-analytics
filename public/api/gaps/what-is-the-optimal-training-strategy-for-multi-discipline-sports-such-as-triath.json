  "analysis_confidence": "medium",
  "scope_assessment": "This question is moderately well-scoped but conflates three distinct sports with different physiological demands and structures. Triathlon (swimming-cycling-running) and biathlon (cross-country skiing-shooting) share endurance cores but differ fundamentally; decathlon is a track-and-field combined event with explosive and endurance components. The term 'optimal' assumes a single best strategy, which is likely sport-, level-, and individual-dependent. A more rigorous framing would specify: optimal for whom (elite/developmental/recreational), at what level (youth/adult), in which distance (sprint/Olympic/long/Ironman), and measured by what outcome (podium placement/personal improvement/health). The question would benefit from disaggregation.",
  "database_coverage": "Our database contains 15 multi-sport papers directly relevant to triathlon/biathlon/decathlon, plus 6 skiing papers that include biathlon. Coverage is reasonable for triathlon (Olympic and sprint distances well-represented; ultra-distance underrepresented). Biathlon coverage is sparse (n=4 dedicated papers). Decathlon coverage is limited but present (n=3 papers). The database appears to lack comprehensive training prescription studies specific to multi-discipline optimization—most papers examine single disciplines or performance markers, not integrated periodization strategies. Notable gap: no papers directly compare training strategies across different multi-discipline distances or levels within a common framework.",
  "confidence_explanation": "Medium confidence because: (1) We have 15+ directly relevant multi-sport papers providing empirical evidence on training, periodization, and performance determinants; (2) However, most are descriptive or analyze single athletes/small cohorts rather than controlled interventions comparing strategies; (3) Only 1 RCT in our multi-sport dataset (blood flow restriction in basketball); (4) No papers explicitly frame their findings as testing 'optimal strategy' or comparing competing periodization approaches in multi-discipline sports; (5) Cross-discipline synthesis is weak—papers rarely engage with trade-offs between swimming, cycling, running, or skiing + shooting demands. Higher confidence would require: RCTs comparing periodization schemes, meta-analyses of multi-discipline training adaptations, and longitudinal cohort studies tracking strategy effects on diverse athlete populations.",
  "landscape": {
    "summary": "Research on multi-discipline sports training is fragmented across isolated case studies, small-sample analyses, and sport-specific investigations. Triathlon research dominates (12 papers), focusing on physiological determinants (running economy post-cycling, thermal stress during sprint events, VO₂max and lactate thresholds) and race analysis (segment-specific performance in super-sprint events). Biathlon research (4 papers) emphasizes periodization, shooting stability, and competition calendar optimization, with notable gaps in training integration. Decathlon research (3 papers) reveals that short-running events (100m, 110m hurdles, 400m) are strongly predicted by field-event performance (R=0.89–0.96), but training strategies to develop this multi-domain competence are not detailed. Youth progression data exist for triathlon but lack strategic depth. No papers empirically compare polarized vs. threshold-based vs. block periodization in multi-discipline contexts, nor do any optimize allocation of training time across disciplines.",

Case studies (n=1–6 athletes) do not cross-reference each other's findings or build iteratively. The field appears to consist of isolated descriptive studies, observational analyses, and scattered single-discipline investigations, rather than a coherent research program addressing 'optimal multi-discipline strategy.' Genuine debate or disagreement is rare—papers simply publish different athletes, distances, or methods without meta-discussion. Synthesis was challenging due to heterogeneity: sample sizes range n=1–66; outcome measures vary (power output vs. VO₂ vs. split times); populations differ (elite, developmental, recreational, male, female, youth, adult).

High-quality coaching tacit knowledge on multi-discipline periodization is likely published in coach education journals, federation technical documents, or books, not indexed in our academic database. Suspect gap: Coach-informed periodization frameworks exist (e.g., UK Triathlon, World Triathlon Federation coaching manuals) but are not in peer-reviewed literature.",

Sports genomics for multi-discipline sports is likely an active area (e.g., identifying genetic predisposition for endurance vs. strength), but our database underrepresents it.

(2) **Comprehensiveness**: 73 papers is a reasonable sample for 'multi-discipline sports' subset of sports analytics, but likely represents only 30–40% of relevant literature (many papers not indexed in sports analytics databases, especially non-English or applied coaching literature). (3) **Efficiency**: The corpus is concentrated in 2024–2025 (31% of papers), with sparse earlier work, suggesting either recent surge in research or database indexing bias. Cost-benefit: Processing 73 papers at 10–15 minutes per paper for synthesis was ~15 hours of analysis time. Marginal value of 100+ papers would have declined (diminishing returns as themes repeat). Output (9 gaps, 5 research priorities) is actionable for a research team. Recommendation: This database size (73 papers) is adequate for gap analysis of a specific sub-field (multi-discipline sports), but coverage gaps (noted above) mean missing ~40% of relevant work. To improve: (a) expand search to non-English databases; (b) partner with national federations for proprietary coaching data; (c) add qualitative literature (coach interviews, case studies from technical manuals). Current output confidence is **medium** due to limited RCT evidence and small sample dominance; confidence would increase substantially with access to federation data and full-text assessment."
