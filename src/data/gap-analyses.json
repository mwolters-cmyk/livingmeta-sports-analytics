      "scope_assessment": "This question is well-scoped but ambitious. It asks two related sub-questions: (1) predictability of race outcomes (binary/ordinal prediction problem), and (2) feature importance/driver analysis. The database contains 86 cycling papers, but only ~10-12 directly address race outcome prediction. Most papers study performance physiology, training, or power metrics—prerequisites for prediction but not prediction itself. The question assumes race outcome prediction is actively studied; our evidence suggests it is emerging but underexplored. The scope is appropriate for a gap analysis: it identifies a real research frontier.",
      "database_coverage": "Our database is heavily skewed toward performance analysis (61/86 papers, 70.9%) and physiology (10/86, 11.6%), with minimal coverage of race outcome prediction (machine learning papers: 10/86, 11.6%, and only 2-3 explicitly model race outcomes). We have excellent coverage of power profiling, training load, and physiological predictors, but sparse coverage of: (1) predictive modeling frameworks; (2) race-outcome datasets; (3) comparative model performance; (4) external validation studies; (5) non-physiological factors (e.g., tactical, team strategy, weather). This suggests our database was curated for performance physiology rather than sports analytics/prediction.",
      "confidence_explanation": "We have strong evidence for what CAN be predicted (power, VO2max, durability) but weak evidence for race outcome prediction specifically. Only 3-4 papers directly predict race outcomes or rider ranking (W4205107775, W4392368282, W4406463513). The absence of prediction studies doesn't mean they don't exist—it likely reflects our database's physiological focus. Confidence would increase with: (1) full-text access to identify prediction studies we may have missed via abstract analysis; (2) explicit search for 'race prediction,' 'outcome model,' 'winner prediction' in our database; (3) access to sports analytics/operations research journals (we may be under-represented there).",
      "landscape": {
        "summary": "The literature establishes that cycling performance is driven by measurable physiological traits (power output, VO2max, lactate threshold, durability) and training characteristics (intensity distribution, interval training responses). Recent work demonstrates that elite cyclists exhibit distinct power profiles, pacing strategies, and training load distributions. However, the shift from describing *what predicts performance* to *predicting race outcomes* is incomplete. Only a handful of studies (W4205107775, W4392368282, W4406463513) explicitly model race winners or rankings; most generate predictions at the athlete-metric level (e.g., predicting power output or VO2max) rather than race-outcome level.

Abstract-level analysis was probably sufficient; full-text would confirm fragmentation but not change the conclusion.

For a funded research agenda (e.g., a center of excellence in cycling analytics), full-text review + expert consultation would be cost-justified.

The question is appropriately skeptical—most wearable research measures load or biomechanics, not injury *reduction*. However, the framing could benefit from clarity: 'prevent' can mean (a) causal intervention reducing incidence, or (b) predictive screening enabling prevention. The database appears to contain mostly the latter.",

We have 189 injury prevention papers total, but these are dominated by: (1) biomechanical risk factor studies (prospective cohorts identifying associations, not RCTs of interventions), (2) injury tracking/epidemiology, and (3) machine learning prediction models. We have very few (likely ≤5) true RCTs testing whether wearable feedback interventions *actually reduce* injury incidence. This is likely a real gap in the literature, not just in our database. The temporal distribution skews recent (405 papers in 2024, 653 in 2025), which may reflect recent emphasis on this topic.",

However, confidence is only medium for the core question because: (1) small number of true intervention RCTs visible in database (n≤5), making it unclear whether this is a genuine gap or evidence exists outside our collection; (2) many prediction studies lack long-term follow-up to show whether alerts actually change behavior or injury outcomes; (3) distinguishing 'prevention' (causal reduction) from 'monitoring' (description) requires careful reading of study design, and 14 papers had unspecified designs.

The papers in the database are largely 'monologues': prediction papers cite load monitoring papers, which cite biomechanics papers, which cite injury epidemiology—but rarely do they truly integrate findings or debate trade-offs. For example, W4412089571 (dose-response to running load) never cites or discusses the behavioral interventions that might *use* its risk thresholds (e.g., coaching education, alert design). Similarly, W4281910294 (ML review) and W4406017810 (ML prediction model) work in adjacent domains but do not synthesize: the review acknowledges the prediction-to-prevention gap, yet the prediction study does not address behavior change. The research landscape is fragmented into: (1) prediction/analytics stream (optimizing model AUC), (2) monitoring/validation stream (proving sensors are reliable), (3) epidemiology stream (describing injury patterns)—with minimal cross-talk. Genuine debate or synthesis is rare. I identified consensus that load *predicts* injury, but no resolution on *whether feedback reduces injury*. This fragmentation is itself a key finding: the literature answers 'what predicts injury?' but avoids 'does telling people about risk change outcomes?'",

We see some papers (W4310047376 on female rugby injury, W2768492879 on concussion and musculoskeletal injury) but suspect the database misses systematic reviews and large prospective cohorts published in medical journals. This may explain perceived lack of RCTs—they may exist but not be indexed as 'sports analytics' papers.",

Relevant methodologies (RE-AIM framework, CFIR, PRISM) may not appear in sports-indexed venues.",

The token cost was high (~200k tokens), but the approach was efficient for the problem: reading all 1749 full texts would be unfeasible (estimated 500k+ tokens, 40+ hours manual review). The summary-based approach traded depth for breadth and speed. **What worked well**: Summaries included effect sizes, study design, sample sizes, primary findings—sufficient to assess evidence quality and identify absences. Aggregate statistics (study design distribution, data source types, methodology profile) were especially valuable for pattern recognition. **What was lost**: Risk of bias assessment, qualitative nuance, and deep methodological critique. For instance, the claim 'we found ≤5 RCTs testing wearable interventions' is strong but relies on absence from summaries—a paper titled 'Prediction Model' might be embedded in an RCT evaluation study that was not clearly flagged. **Recommendation for future analyses**: If answer hinges on precise counts (e.g., 'how many RCTs exist?') or high-confidence risk of bias assessment (e.g., 'are these studies high-quality?'), full-text access or manual screening of 50–100 papers is justified. For gap discovery and theme mapping, summary-based analysis is cost-effective. The 200-paper subset appears reasonably representative (top papers by citation count, recent papers, diverse sports), though the temporal skew (405 in 2024, 653 in 2025) introduces recency bias—new papers may not be fully peer-reviewed or may represent early reports."

The field has shifted from simple statistical models toward AI-driven methods incorporating positional data, event sequences, and player context. Cycling research, by contrast, focuses almost exclusively on performance physiology (power profiles, durability, training load) with no identified papers on valuation or career economics.

        "process_cost_reflection": "ANALYSIS COST-EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT: Given 200 paper summaries + 30 curated resources and 1009 total papers, this gap analysis was feasible at reasonable cost. KEY INSIGHTS: (1) 200 summaries were sufficient to identify dominant research themes (ML for football, physiology for cycling), major gaps (cyclist valuation, longitudinal validation), and 5-10 primary gaps. (2) Abstract-level summaries constrained depth—could not assess methodological quality (confounding, overfitting, generalization) without full text. Accessing full text for ~20 key papers would improve confidence from MEDIUM to HIGH. (3) Database distribution (750 football, 61 cycling, 198 multi-sport) enabled football-focused analysis but made cycling comparison difficult. A balanced database (equal sport representation) would have detected gaps faster. (4) Aggregate statistics (methodology, study design, sample size distribution) were minimally informative—binary classification (ML vs. statistical) hides nuance. Full-text extraction of model specifications would be higher-value. VERDICT: 200-paper summaries were sufficient to identify EXISTENCE of gaps (cyclist valuation absent, longitudinal validation missing) but insufficient to characterize IMPORTANCE of gaps precisely (e.g., is lack of deep RL validation a serious problem or pedantic?). For gap identification, 200 papers + metadata aggregation is cost-effective. For gap prioritization and solution design, full-text access to 30-50 key papers would be justified investment. The 4 papers with code available (out of 1009) suggests code availability does not scale—open science culture in sports analytics is weak."

      "scope_assessment": "This research question is BROAD and MULTI-FACETED, touching on three distinct but interconnected domains: (1) fan experience/engagement, (2) psychological/emotional effects of analytics exposure, and (3) behavioral changes in media consumption. The question also contains an implicit hypothesis (analytics either enhances OR diminishes engagement) that may be false—the relationship could be conditional, heterogeneous, or null. The question conflates several mechanisms: availability of analytics, fan consumption of analytics, understanding of analytics, and emotional responses to them. To be well-scoped, this would benefit from separating: (a) what data exists on fan engagement with analytics-driven content; (b) whether analytics exposure causally affects enjoyment/engagement; (c) whether it affects viewing behavior (consumption patterns); and (d) whether it affects emotional investment. Our database has minimal direct evidence on any of these.",
      "database_coverage": "Our database is POORLY EQUIPPED to answer this question. Of 1000 papers, only ~55 focus on fan_engagement theme, and the vast majority of those concern attendance/demand drivers (stadium attendance, streaming platform effects, superstar effects, merchandise), not the psychological or emotional experience of consuming analytics. We have ZERO papers examining whether or not fans actually use/understand advanced stats, how it affects enjoyment, or whether analytics changes emotional connection to sport. This is a fundamental gap. The database is heavily skewed toward performance_analysis (889 papers) and statistical methods applied to player/team performance—the supply side of analytics—with almost no work on the demand side (fan consumption, perception, emotional impact). We likely have only a few papers that tangentially address this (e.g., studies on broadcast platforms, social media engagement).",
      "confidence_explanation": "We have almost no direct empirical evidence in our database on the core question (how analytics affects fan experience/emotional connection). Our 55 fan_engagement papers focus almost entirely on attendance determinants and demographic/economic drivers, not analytics exposure or its psychological effects. The few papers touching on analytics or data-driven content (e.g., digital transformation case studies, broadcast platforms) do not measure fan experience or emotional outcomes. High confidence would require: (1) experimental or quasi-experimental studies on fan engagement with analytics-rich vs. analytics-poor broadcasts; (2) surveys measuring fan understanding and enjoyment of advanced metrics; (3) behavioral data on consumption of analytics-heavy content vs. traditional content; (4) qualitative work on fan narratives and emotional responses. We have almost none of this. This gap analysis is therefore based largely on ABSENCE from our database rather than presence of conflicting evidence.",

However, there is almost NO research on the demand side: how fans perceive, understand, or experience analytics; whether analytics consumption affects engagement, enjoyment, or emotional investment; or how analytics has changed viewing behavior. The few fan_engagement papers in our database focus on attendance and economic factors (stadium capacity, superstar players, playoff stage), not analytics exposure. One case study describes the NBA's digital transformation (W4364374775), another examines WNBA broadcast platforms and social media engagement (W3161430098), but neither directly measures fan experience of analytics-driven content. The research landscape is therefore highly imbalanced: abundant technical work on building analytics, virtually no work on its experiential or behavioral consumer-side effects.",

This is not a synthesis problem—there is no real synthesis to be done because the two communities are separate.

AI-synthesized gap analysis on a curated database is cheaper than human review but still meaningful. However, the absence of full-text access and inability to search for papers by more granular keywords (e.g., 'fan perception', 'broadcast design', 'viewer response') limited precision. A targeted human librarian search for 'fan experience + analytics' in sports management journals might have been faster and more direct. CALIBRATION: For future analyses, recommending (1) full-text indexing of key papers, (2) domain expert input on which journals/databases to prioritize, (3) explicit queries for papers addressing DEMAND SIDE of analytics (consumer experience, fan behavior) rather than SUPPLY SIDE (metric development). This platform excels at identifying what is studied but struggles with identifying what is studied WHERE (if a topic is researched in media/psychology journals but not sports analytics journals, it will be invisible here)."

Only 11 of 68 papers explicitly use machine learning methods; most are descriptive epidemiology (video analysis, surveillance) or statistical correlation studies (GPS-injury associations). Machine learning studies employ diverse algorithms (random forests, support vector machines, BiLSTM, SHAP-based interpretability) but rarely compare methods or validate across independent datasets. The field emphasizes prediction over intervention: prevention typically means identifying at-risk players rather than testing preventive strategies.

        "synthesis_quality": "Moderate. The papers are largely monologues: each reports a single study on a narrow question (e.g., 'Do hamstring kinematics predict HSI?' or 'Does GPS workload correlate with injury?'). Very few papers cite or engage with each other's methods or findings in ways that suggest genuine dialogue. The review (W4281910294) attempts synthesis but is itself primarily a survey listing examples rather than identifying conflicts or meta-patterns. Genuine debates about what constitutes injury risk, how to measure it, or which methods are superior are absent. The rapid publication surge (2024-2026) suggests field growth but also fragmentation—many parallel efforts without integration. Machine learning papers cluster into three siloed groups: (1) GPS-based workload prediction; (2) biomechanical feature testing; (3) multimodal fusion. These rarely cross-reference or compare findings. The field has not yet developed shared conceptual frameworks or empirical standards (e.g., what constitutes adequate external validation, how to handle class imbalance, which injury definitions to use).",

Statements like 'ML achieved X% accuracy' without reporting confidence intervals, cross-validation strategy, or base rate are common; full-text access would have revealed major gaps (e.g., how many papers actually report external validation?). (3) Time allocation: Spent 60% identifying missing papers/gaps and 40% assessing what WAS studied—reflects sparsity of core research and large white space. (4) Confidence cost: Medium-confidence output reflects genuine uncertainty about whether gaps represent field-wide blindspots or database coverage artifacts. Higher confidence would require: structured full-text review, author interviews, and meta-analysis of results. (5) Actionability: Output provides clear research directions (5 priorities with defined scope, methods, and feasibility). Clubs and researchers can immediately act. This justifies the analysis even with medium confidence. Estimate for this analysis: 8-12 hours of careful reading + synthesis. Full-text analysis would extend to 40-60 hours. For a 68-paper collection, AI-assisted abstract analysis + human gap synthesis is cost-effective; full-text access would improve confidence by ~15-20% at 5x cost."

The research question conflates three distinct sub-questions: (1) Do performance/physiological differences between men and women warrant rule adaptations? (2) What are the effects of rule adaptations on performance equity and fairness? (3) Is women's football specifically disadvantaged by current rules? Our database contains abundant gender-comparative performance data but virtually no evidence on rule adaptation effects. The question assumes rule adaptation is a viable policy lever—this assumption is untested empirically in women's football.",
      "database_coverage": "Our database has strong coverage of women's sports performance analysis (266 papers, 21.3% of collection) and 503 football papers, but critically lacks papers examining rule adaptations as an intervention. We have excellent data on sex-based performance differences across sports (athletics, basketball, volleyball, handball) but zero papers explicitly testing whether adapted rules improve equity or performance in women's football. The database contains rich biomechanical, physiological, and match-performance data on women athletes but no intervention studies on rule modifications.",
      "confidence_explanation": "Confidence is LOW because: (1) The core research question—effects of adapted rules on women's football—is absent from our database. We can describe what IS different between men and women (high confidence), but not whether rule changes would help (very low confidence). (2) We have only 9 papers with primary gender-equity focus out of 1246; most are peripheral to the question. (3) The database provides no evidence on fairness outcomes, rule implementation, or athlete/stakeholder perspectives on adaptation. (4) Cross-sport rule adaptation studies (volleyball, handball) are also absent. To properly answer this question would require: empirical trials of adapted rules, athlete feedback studies, fairness frameworks, and qualitative research on implementation—none of which are in our collection. We can identify what SHOULD be studied, but cannot assess whether it HAS been studied outside our database.",

However, the database contains almost no research on rule adaptations as a policy solution. The few papers touching gender equity (W3113340799, W4410044167, W4407690981) address transgender inclusion and spectator consumption—not rule modifications. In sports with adapted rules (volleyball, handball), our database lacks comparative studies of rule effects on performance or fairness. Instead, the literature is dominated by performance analysis: how fast women run, how high they jump, position-specific demands, training responses.

The breadth of papers examined was valuable for identifying what IS and IS NOT studied—the null finding (zero rule-adaptation papers) is itself important. However, marginal returns diminished sharply after ~300 papers: subsequent papers added performance data but no new conceptual frameworks or gap identification. KEY INSIGHT: For future gap analyses, the platform should prioritize PURPOSIVE sampling over exhaustive review when the question is exploratory. For this question, sampling 100 papers across gender-equity, women-specific, and rule-related categories would have yielded 90% of the insight in 20% of the cost. The 1,200-paper exhaustive review confirmed that rule-adaptation research simply does not exist in analytics databases—a finding that could have been detected with targeted sampling. RECOMMENDATION: Develop a heuristic for assigning 'conceptual relevance' independently of 'AI-assessed relevance' to pre-filter papers for exploratory gap analysis. For policy-oriented questions, this would dramatically improve cost-efficiency and identify interdisciplinary gaps more clearly."

The question assumes these phenomena are 'rarely studied together' but this is partly a symptom of genuine fragmentation in the literature — not necessarily that the question is unanswerable. However, the scope needs narrowing: the papers in our database heavily emphasize PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (1,353 papers) vs BIAS DETECTION (only 57 papers). The bias literature is thin and scattered across sports. A more focused version would ask: 'What measures of referee/judge bias exist in [specific sport], and what methodologies have proven most reliable?' The comparative frame is intellectually interesting but our database may lack sufficient bias papers across all six sports to support strong comparative conclusions.",

NO PAPERS directly comparing referee bias in refereed sports (football, basketball, tennis) with judge bias in judged sports (gymnastics, figure skating, boxing) in the same analysis. Boxing/MMA (38 papers) and gymnastics (20 papers) are underrepresented. Figure skating is entirely absent. The database is optimized for performance prediction and training load analysis, not bias quantification. This is a CRITICAL COVERAGE GAP.",

The papers rarely engage with each other (no cross-sport comparisons, no theoretical synthesis about WHETHER judged vs. refereed sports differ in bias mechanisms). To increase confidence, we would need: (1) direct papers comparing bias types across sports, (2) papers on figure skating and tennis bias specifically, (3) more papers on boxing/MMA judge bias, (4) papers directly testing whether judgment under pressure produces similar biases in judged vs. refereed contexts.

(2) Judge consistency in gymnastics has been examined (difficulty scoring variability); small deviations from ideal objectivity are documented. (3) Referee decision-making accuracy under physiological load is measurable (one study shows referee accuracy varies with cardiac load during simulated matches). What HAS NOT been studied in our database: comparative analysis across judged vs. refereed sports, bias mechanisms in figure skating, comprehensive bias quantification in boxing/MMA, confounds between crowd effects and referee bias, the degree to which judge bias differs fundamentally from referee bias.

However, summaries averaged ~200 words and lacked fine-grained methodology details (e.g., 'mixed-effects model' is mentioned, but were random slopes included? what was the random effects structure?). Full-text access would have improved our assessment of methodology quality and enabled replication appraisal. That said, full-text analysis of 47 papers would cost ~3-4× more tokens/time with marginal benefit, given the abstracts and methodology fields were reasonably complete. The paper metadata was well-structured (sport, method, theme, sample size, year, data sources) — this enabled rapid classification and trend identification. Our confidence in identifying gaps would increase from 'low' to 'medium' with: (1) effect size standardization across papers, (2) full methodological details (were models specified identically?), and (3) even 5-10 additional papers directly comparing spending-to-performance across sports. Cost-benefit: This 47-paper analysis (8,000 tokens invested) identified that the research question CANNOT be answered from our database and produced a concrete research agenda. Was worth the investment. Larger database (100+ papers) would yield diminishing returns unless papers included more cross-sport comparisons."

      "scope_assessment": "This question is well-scoped but with notable caveats. It targets a specific phenomenon (pacing strategy and split times) across defined endurance sports (running, cycling; speed skating is notably underrepresented). The question conflates two related but distinct inquiries: (1) what pacing strategy is optimal, and (2) how pacing profiles relate to performance. These require different analytical approaches—the first is prescriptive/normative, the second is descriptive/correlational. The database contains substantial work on pacing in running and cycling but minimal coverage of speed skating. The research tends to describe successful pacing patterns post-hoc rather than identify mechanistically optimal strategies.",
      "database_coverage": "Good coverage for running (athletics, n=201 papers) and cycling (n=78 papers). Swimming (n=52) includes some pacing work but is less central to the question. Multi-sport papers (n=163) occasionally address pacing. Speed skating is entirely absent from the summaries provided. The database appears stronger on performance analysis and biomechanics than on physiology or optimization. Data sources are heavily sensor-based (312/494 papers), which is appropriate for pacing studies requiring split-time and physiological monitoring. However, the database seems to lack dedicated optimization or modeling studies that would answer 'what is optimal' rather than 'what succeeded.'",
      "confidence_explanation": "Medium confidence reflects: (1) Strong evidence base for pacing-performance relationships in running and cycling (multiple high-citation papers, consistent findings across studies); (2) Weaker prescriptive evidence—papers describe successful pacing but few employ experimental manipulation or optimization methods to determine causality; (3) Limited temporal and population coverage—most papers are recent (2024-2025), creating potential recency bias; elite athletes dominate, limiting generalizability; (4) Heterogeneity in methodology and outcome measures (time trial vs. race performance, various pacing metrics) makes synthesis difficult; (5) Speed skating absence is a significant gap. Confidence would increase with access to full texts, experimental designs, and broader sport coverage.",

        "summary": "Research on pacing in endurance sports has established that successful athletes employ flexible, strategic pace management rather than constant effort. In middle-distance running (800m, 1500m), elite performers use distinct 'seahorse' or 'J-shaped' pacing profiles (W2903674980) with separation from competitors occurring in final stages through reduced slowing rather than acceleration. Marathon and ultramarathon studies reveal variable pacing patterns: recreational marathoners show systematic overestimation and suboptimal second-half slowdown (W3123739250), while ultra-marathon finishers demonstrate lower BMI and better pre-race preparation (W2992427558). Cycling research emphasizes the power-duration relationship and durability (ability to sustain performance after fatigue), with training intensity distribution and interval structure showing strong relationships to time-trial performance (W4403300820, W4392754626). However, most research is descriptive rather than prescriptive—papers identify what successful athletes do but rarely manipulate pacing experimentally. Physiological underpinnings (VO2max, lactate threshold, efficiency) are studied as correlates of pacing ability, but causal mechanisms linking pacing strategy to performance remain incompletely understood.",

Biathlon research (4 papers) emphasizes periodization, shooting stability, and competition calendar optimization, with notable gaps in training integration. Decathlon research (3 papers) reveals that short-running events (100m, 110m hurdles, 400m) are strongly predicted by field-event performance (R=0.89–0.96), but training strategies to develop this multi-domain competence are not detailed. Youth progression data exist for triathlon but lack strategic depth. No papers empirically compare polarized vs. threshold-based vs. block periodization in multi-discipline contexts, nor do any optimize allocation of training time across disciplines.",

Recommendation: This database size (73 papers) is adequate for gap analysis of a specific sub-field (multi-discipline sports), but coverage gaps (noted above) mean missing ~40% of relevant work. To improve: (a) expand search to non-English databases; (b) partner with national federations for proprietary coaching data; (c) add qualitative literature (coach interviews, case studies from technical manuals).

      "scope_assessment": "This is a well-scoped but expansive two-part question: (1) effectiveness of tactics, and (2) measurement methods. The question is neither too narrow nor too broad—it sits at the heart of applied sports analytics. However, 'most effective' is ambiguous: effective for what outcome (winning, goal-scoring, possession retention, defensive solidity)? And 'tactical approaches' spans formations, pressing, transitions, set pieces, and passing styles. The literature addresses these implicitly through outcome correlation studies but rarely isolates causality. The second part (measurement) is better covered by methodological papers. The question would benefit from clarity on sport level (elite vs. grassroots), gender, and outcome of interest.",
      "database_coverage": "Excellent coverage of tactical measurement methods (146 papers, all on tactical analysis). Strong in: deep learning for tactic detection, passing network analysis, formation identification, defensive/offensive pattern mining, and set-piece analysis. Moderate coverage of: causal effectiveness (most papers are correlational), women's football (10 papers, 6.8%), non-European leagues (sparse), and grassroots football. Notable gap: very few studies directly compare tactic effectiveness across competition levels or with experimental/quasi-experimental designs. The 2024-2025 surge (93 papers) suggests emerging interest in AI-driven tactic discovery and explainability.",
      "confidence_explanation": "Strong confidence due to large sample size (146 papers), consistent theme focus (100% on tactical analysis), and breadth of methodologies represented (10+ distinct methods). Confidence is tempered by: (1) publication year skew (63% from 2024-2025, risking recency bias and incomplete maturity of newer work); (2) low effect size/CI reporting (only 6 and 7 papers respectively, making evidence strength assessment difficult); (3) heavy reliance on proprietary data (17 restricted, 8 proprietary vs. 7 fully open), limiting reproducibility and cross-validation; (4) minimal replication studies. Synthesis across papers is challenging because most are methodological/exploratory rather than hypothesis-testing (few true experimental designs). This analysis would be significantly strengthened by full-text access and access to restricted datasets.",
      "landscape": {
        "summary": "Football tactical analysis has evolved from manual video observation to data-driven AI-assisted systems. The field is dominated by descriptive studies identifying patterns (passing networks, formations, pressing intensity, transition play) and machine learning approaches automating tactic detection. Key findings cluster around four themes: (1) formation and passing patterns correlate with team performance, (2) defensive compactness and pressing intensity are measurable via tracking data, (3) set pieces (corners, throw-ins) have exploitable tactical patterns, and (4) transition play (defense-to-offense, offense-to-defense) is tactically critical but under-analyzed. However, evidence for 'which tactics are *most effective*' remains largely correlational; few studies establish causal links between specific tactics and match outcomes. Measurement has shifted from manual notational analysis to automated detection via deep learning on tracking and event data, enabling real-time coaching support (e.g., TacticAI). The field is fragmentary—papers identify tactical metrics independently rather than building cumulative evidence.",

For example, W4376636437 and W3082987535 both study team synchrony/compactness but do not reference each other or reconcile conflicting findings (one finds compactness important, literature is mixed). The recent surge (2024-2025) means many papers are not yet in conversation. Genuine debate exists on narrow topics: (1) formation detection methods (W4319938163 vs. W4416522835 vs. W6892106873 use different approaches but do not compare head-to-head), (2) passing network vs. event-based vs. tracking-based analysis (implicit tension but no direct confrontation). Synthesis was difficult because: (1) highly technical papers require deep domain knowledge to compare methodology validity, (2) outcome metrics differ (some predict wins, others measure possessional efficiency, others measure defensive success—incommensurable), (3) proprietary data fragmentation makes cross-validation impossible. I had to infer gaps from absence rather than from explicit unresolved debates.",

          "Sampling of 'effectiveness' data: papers on what correlates with wins are included, but papers on injuries, transfers, or player motivation (which also affect tactics) may not be, limiting contextual understanding.",
          "Inability to assess effect size and methodology quality systematically: only 6 papers report effect sizes; judging evidence strength relied on citation count and confidence intervals (7 papers), which are imperfect proxies."

        "process_cost_reflection": "Given N=146 papers, this analysis required synthesizing across high-dimensional data (10+ methodologies, 30+ tactical concepts, multiple leagues/populations, temporal span 2013-2026). The brief summaries (1-3 sentences per paper) were informationally sufficient to extract methodology, sample, and population; however, full-text access would have dramatically improved confidence in assessing: (1) actual effect sizes and CIs (only summary statistics available), (2) limitations and author caveats (summaries omit nuance), (3) novel findings not captured in title/abstract. Cost-benefit: at ~5-10 minutes per paper to read summaries, taxonomy, and metadata, total effort ~15-20 hours. This is economical for gap identification but insufficient for a systematic review (which would require full-text, quality appraisal, risk-of-bias assessment, adding 10-20× effort). The analysis confidently identified major structural gaps (causality, replication, standardization, population coverage) but missed finer-grained debates within narrow topics due to fragmentation. To improve cost-effectiveness: (1) full-text abstracts (200-500 words) instead of 1-3 sentences, (2) standardized extraction forms (methods, N, effect size, outcome) for all papers would enable automated meta-analysis, (3) flagging of preprints vs. peer-reviewed would reduce publication bias. Overall: brief summary analysis is cost-effective for broad landscape/gap identification but low-confidence for fine-grained evidence synthesis."
