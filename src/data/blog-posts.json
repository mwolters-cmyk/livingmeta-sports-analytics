        "text": "Last week, de Volkskrant published an article about an age-old question in football: does sacking your manager actually make things better? The piece referenced work by Jan van Ours, an economist at Erasmus University Rotterdam, who has spent years studying exactly this. As a sports analytics research platform based at the same university, we couldn't resist: we pointed our AI at our database of nearly 14,000 sports analytics papers and asked it the same question."

Five studies directly examine what happens after a coach gets fired mid-season. And the findings are \u2014 let's say \u2014 uncomfortable for anyone who thinks a new manager is a magic bullet."

Researchers analyzed 115 coach dismissals in the Ekstraklasa between 2006 and 2024 and built counterfactual scenarios: what would have happened if the club had kept their manager? Their conclusion was sobering. The modest performance bump you see after a sacking is almost entirely explained by regression to the mean. Teams were performing below their expected level, so they bounced back \u2014 with or without a new face in the dugout."

In the Danish Premier League, they did find a genuine improvement after sackings \u2014 but only in home games. Which raises a fascinating question: is the 'new manager bounce' actually about tactics, or about the crowd reacting to the drama of a sacking?"

High-speed running distance, sprint profiles, pressing intensity \u2014 all of these shifted significantly across three coaching regimes at the same club. So coaches do change how teams play. Whether that translates into better results is a separate question."

Jan van Ours's most-cited paper on this topic \u2014 the one the Volkskrant article is about, covering four leagues from 2002 to 2015 \u2014 isn't actually in our database yet. Our platform monitors sports analytics journals and conferences, but Van Ours publishes in economics journals like the Economic Journal and the Journal of Sports Economics.

The new-manager bounce is real, but it might have happened anyway."
