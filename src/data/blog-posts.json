The piece referenced Jan van Ours, an economist who has studied exactly this question using Eredivisie data. Feyenoord just went through it themselves \u2014 Brian Priske out, Robin van Persie in. So we pointed our AI at our database of nearly 14,000 sports analytics papers and asked: what does the evidence actually say?"

Their key insight: yes, teams perform better after a sacking \u2014 but so do teams in similar slumps that kept their coach. The improvement is regression to the mean, not a coaching effect. They used bookmaker odds to construct a control group of 'near-dismissals' that didn't happen, and found no significant difference."
